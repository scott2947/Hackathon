            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <p>Welcome to TimeFlow, your ultimate tool to maintain a stable mental well-being amidst the turmoil of your hectic university life.
                There are 3 key features available to you here.</p>
            <h2>Meditation</h2>
            <p>Take a break for 5, 10 or even 15 minutes, to rest your mind and unwind as you are guided by our team through a series of breathing 
                and mental exercises. Select the meditation tab, then choose the exercise that suits your needs the best. Press play to take a well 
                deserved break, leaving you rejuvenated for the tasks you must face next.</p>
            <h2>Pomodoro</h2>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work 
                into intervals of your liking, separated by short breaks. When you need to start working again, select the Pomodoro tab, then choose 
                a preset based on how long you plan to spend on working on the task at hand. Next, start your work, and persevere till the timer 
                rings. You may then take a small breather for the duration of the next timer, before going back to work again. The cycles continue 
                till the allotted time is up and you have finished with your task.</p>
            <h2>To-Do List</h2>
            <p>The To-Do List minimizes stress by allowing you to clearly list the jobs you have left, and tick them off when you're finished with 
                them. Select the To-Do List tab, then write all the tasks you remember that you have on the list. You may add to or detract from 
                this list at any time. When you finish a task, you may mark it as complete, so your progress in various tasks is clearly visible 
                to you, allowing you to remain organised.</p>
